**I start working again on this project beginning next year 2025**. In the meantime looking for sponsors to pay for the required work necessary for the successful completion of this project.  <br>

I have also available here, on Github, a C++ library for the [Dataverse API](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/OpenScience-Dataverse-API-C-library) (data repositories). To view click [here](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/OpenScience-Dataverse-API-C-library). <br>


This is a C++-based library intended for embedded firmware development, however, it can be easily ported and made compatible with any platform or operating system. see the [WIKI](h) for more information.

<br>

GitHub is a web-based platform designed for version control and collaborative software development. It allows developers to manage and track changes to their code using Git, a version control system. With GitHub, multiple contributors can work on a project simultaneously, making it easy to collaborate, review, and integrate changes. It also provides features like issue tracking, pull requests, and code reviews, facilitating streamlined teamwork and ensuring code integrity over time. Additionally, GitHub hosts millions of open-source projects, allowing users to share and contribute to global software development.

**Test the API** <br>
There's a test code .ino file available for Arduino-compatible microcontrollers, such as EspressIF's ESP32, to test connectivity with a dataverse API. Link to the code: <br>

- [Go API for GitHub](https://github.com/google/go-github)
- [Python API for GitHub](https://github.com/PyGithub/PyGithub)

### Coding standards

Please make sure tests pass before committing, and to add new tests for new additions.

## Instalation & usage

To learn how to install and use this library, goto the wiki page [here]() or by clicking on the top menu.

There's an ongoing research project to develop a "[Proof of Concept of a Smart DAQ Device able to Upload Live Experimental Sensor Data to a Data Repository with a Unique Data Fingerprint](https://github.com/aeonSolutions/openScienceResearch-Smart-DAQ-Device-able-to-Upload-Live-Experimental-Sensor-Data-to-a-Data-Repo)"  that discusses an innovative proof-of-concept method for management of collected experimental data in real-time and compatible with any open environment. The proposed proof-of-concept smart DAQ device has the minimum hardware characteristics to handle data measurements collection from sensors locally connected to it, store it on a local CSV or SQLite database file and finally connect and synchronize data measurements collected with a data repository hosted remotely on a Dataverse.

## Academic Credit & Best Practices
By depositing data into a GitHub repository, which can be customized or embedded into a website with GitHub's [Theme + Widgets]() feature, researchers make their datasets more discoverable to the scientific community. 

By increasing research data's visibility with GitHub, researchers can get recognition and academic credit for their scholarly work through a [data citation](). These citations also help ensure that when research data is published, funder and publisher requirements are met, and data is reused by other scholars, replicated for verification, and tracked to measure usage and impact over time, which can help fund future research.


A data citation in a GitHub repository is required to have the  following components:
- author name(s)
- year (date published in the GitHub repository)
- title
- global persistent identifier: [DOI](http://www.doi.org/) or [Handle](http://handle.net/)
- publisher (repository that published the dataset)
- version number
- [universal numerical fingerprint](http://guides.dataverse.org/en/latest/developers/unf/index.html) (UNF): for tabular data

Here is an example of a replication data citation from Political Analysis, Hanmer, Banks, and White, 2013:


> Hanmer, Michael J.; Banks, Antoine J., White, Ismail K., 2013, "Replication data for:
> Experiments to Reduce the Over-reporting of Voting: A Pipeline to the Truth",
> [doi:10.7910/DVN/22893](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/22893), Harvard Dataverse, V2, UNF:5:eJOVAjDU0E0jzSQ2bRCg9g==
